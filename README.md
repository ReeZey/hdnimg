# hdnimg - hidden in plain sight
this is a small tool for adding bytes in images by changing the least significant bit, which will not change the appearance of the image   
* the bit count can be manually changed, but be careful setting the bit_count to 8 (the max) will effectively make the tool replace the image pixels.
